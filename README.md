This repository contains tools for collecting and analyzing subway survey data. The following components are included:

* Drivers for transferring data between certain sensors and a computer;
* An annotation tool for live recording of train position and status, including fields for recording manual observations and a number pad for recording numeric data manually; and
* A tool for aligning annotations produced by the annotation tool with collected vibration data, to produce more accurate annotations than could be produced during surveying.
